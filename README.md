Definition of DOne - 
Quality and processes

Test data identified and updated

How can we help teams break it down

Survey - 
What doesn't meet DoR?
Is it practical and achievable

Single product - multiple teams, different DoD
what needs to be applied to? integrated product increment

Not making them stringent

Definition of Done
All stories must comply with the current Definition of Done in order to be considered Complete and Accepted. Some items might not apply to all stories, and conscious exceptions are OK.

Expect this DoD to change over time.

The application.yml configurations have been updated as needed in deployed environments
Database indexes exist for any new queries
The dashboard and sample SPs have been updated if necessary
If multiple database migrations are necessary, the database migrations have been performed
The story is deployed to Dev and/or INT environments
Appropriate refactoring has been done as part of developing the story

Conforms to Section 508 standards by both manual and automated scanning methods
The new design uses components from the design system
Notify the design team when a new design component is not yet in the design system, so it can be added and the team can be notified.
New components that aren‚Äôt a part of the design system are added if they‚Äôre used frequently
Graphics and mockups are saved in design repository. If private mockup/design, save in login drive / design folder
User journey/interface are connected to user personas and listed in the login handbook.
Content
Content changes are written, reviewed and approved.
Content changes are complete for the contact center email templates and knowledge articles.
Documentation
If there is a potential security impact someone has told @Mo about it
If we are affecting storage or transmission of PII somebody has told the privacy officer @richard.speidel
